Jewish people have been vilified for denying the divinity of Jesus Christ; they were unjustly marked as murderers, usurers, and villains of all sorts; they were condemned for their supposed role in defiling and undermining the “white-race”; they were accused of committing the greatest abuses of capitalism, and at the same time, were charged with inventing socialism and Communism.
