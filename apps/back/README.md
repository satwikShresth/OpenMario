# Homework 1: REST Api for sqlite db interactions

## Step 1: Installing Deno

Install Deno because this project uses deno as its runtime, I took prior
permission from Prof. Long for this, here is the link to do it if you havent
[DENO](https://deno.com)

## Step 2: Running the Project

I have tried running it and it has worked for me, I have make it work in a
certain way so it suits my dev process

Commands are exaclty same as of npm

```bash
# git clone <your-repo>
# cd <your-repo>
# npm i # install dependencies
# npm run setup # set up your SQLite database
# npm run build # compile your server
# npm run start # start your server
#
# in another terminal...
# npm run test # run your tests


git clone <your-repo>
cd <your-repo>
deno install # install dependencies
deno task setup # set up your SQLite database
deno task build # TS checks your server Since deno can directly run a .ts file
deno task start # start your server

# in another terminal...
deno task test # run your tests
```
