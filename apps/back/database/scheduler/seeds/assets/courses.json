While considerable focus will be on the structural details of select systems, there are recurring patterns that emerge in tissue construction. These patterns reflect regional variations in the functional role of the assembled tissue; studying these principles offers us a view of how small differences in cell number, type, and interaction can lead to the wide variety of tissue/organ properties seen in the human body.",

We examine variations in socio-demographic structures (age, education ratios, and the concentration of poverty) and the physical environment (housing segregation, density of bars, street lighting) predicts variations between neighborhoods in the level of crime and disorder.",

We cover contemporary issues like prosecutorial misconduct, plea bargaining, sentencing guidelines, mandatory minimums, truth in sentencing and the impact of racial and gender disparities. We also spend time investigating special issues within the field such as the sentencing of juveniles and capital sentencing procedures.",

The course offers both a classroom component that grounds students in the academics of policing, as well as a Citizen Police Academy experience to teach certain aspects of policing through practice. Each week, students will study a policing topic in class and then participate in a simulated police activity hosted by Drexel police officers. These simulated activities include car stops, shoot-don't-shoot scenarios, responding to mass shooting events, and drug seizures. Ultimately, this course hopes to integrate two aspects of American policing that are typically separated: How we teach policing, and how we do policing.",

The primary tasks of systematics are 1) the discovery, description, and classification of biodiversity to construct a general reference system for life on Earth; 2) the reconstruction of the \"tree of life\": the descent relationships among units of biodiversity at multiple hierarchic levels from genes to phyla; and 3) the application of reconstructions of decent relationships to the study of evolution. Phylogenetic systematics, concerned with units of biodiversity at the species level and above, will be emphasized.",

By the 1950s, Drexel was a powerhouse as a local provider of technical talent—and it became Drexel University in 1970. As the local economy went through a brutal deindustrial transformation Drexel had to change or face bankruptcy. The 1990s saw Drexel recovering and by the beginning of the new century Drexel evolved again in a period of change marked by the acquisition and founding of medical, nursing, public health schools, and law schools.",

By taking critical moments in the history of climate-human interaction, this course will explore the history of scientific ideas and practices, from the 18th century to the present, that serve as the foundation for modern conceptions of the weather and climate as a global system. Our aim is to put current scientific debates on climate change into historical and critical perspective as we seek to understand the ways climate has been interpreted and understood over time, both within and outside the scientific community.",

Christianity is often considered to be diametrically opposed to Judaism, to be a rejection of the Judaic worldview. Indeed, prominent thinkers in the history of Christianity, such as Martin Luther, have reinforced this position. Yet Christianity was originally a development within Judaism, a sect, so to speak, of Judaism. The earliest Christians were Jewish followers of a Jewish leader and conceived of themselves as faithful Jews. So how did the two religions come to be viewed as opposed? Do elements of Judaism remain as part of the foundation of the new faith of Christianity? Where do the two faiths converge and where do they diverge? This course endeavors to answer these important questions.",

Jewish people have been vilified for denying the divinity of Jesus Christ; they were unjustly marked as murderers, usurers, and villains of all sorts; they were condemned for their supposed role in defiling and undermining the “white-race”; they were accused of committing the greatest abuses of capitalism, and at the same time, were charged with inventing socialism and Communism. What is antisemitism? How did it start? Why is it so enduring? This course will explore the long history of a perplexing and irrational phenomenon. This course will examine the racial, political, and economic forms of antisemitism in the ancient, medieval, and modern world.",

This course will examine Jewish exclusion through the mid-20th century including General Grant’s expulsion of Jews, the Leo Frank lynching and Henry Ford’s Dearborn Independent, Father Coughlin’s antisemitic radio addresses, the Nazi rally and Madison Square Garden.

They owned plantations and participated in extensive trading enterprises in the New World, including sugar cultivation, the triangulated slave trade, trade in precious gems, and the fur-trade. This course will investigate the ways in which Jews participated in colonial environments in the 16th-18th centuries: their business pursuits and their interactions with Europeans, Africans, and Native Americans. It will also explore Jews' improved status in diverse New World environments, and the ways Jews created hybrid communities in environments formerly devoid of Jewish life.",

Amongst other examples, we will examine the role of the US, the impact of the Israeli/Palestinian conflict on democracy in the region, and the role of Islamic and women’s movements in the recent Arab uprisings.

Christianity is often considered to be diametrically opposed to Judaism, to be a rejection of the Judaic worldview. Indeed, prominent thinkers in the history of Christianity, such as Martin Luther, have reinforced this position. Yet Christianity was originally a development within Judaism, a sect, so to speak, of Judaism. The earliest Christians were Jewish followers of a Jewish leader and conceived of themselves as faithful Jews. So how did the two religions come to be viewed as opposed? Do elements of Judaism remain as part of the foundation of the new faith of Christianity? Where do the two faiths converge and where do they diverge? This course endeavors to answer these important questions.",

            "description": "This course will teach students the principles that underline the interaction of light and matter, leading to the understanding of the basis of operation of photonic devices such as lasers, LEDs, solar cells, and photodetectors. The course starts with how understanding of light spectrum that is generated due to heat started the development of the field of quantum mechanics by Max Planck. This is then to include a quantum theory of light, on which basis absorption, stimulated and spontaneous emission are explained. Interaction of light with semiconductors is analyzed and shows how lasers, LEDs and photodetectors work, and how modern photonics is able to solve great challenges of humanity, such as lighting or optical data communication.",
